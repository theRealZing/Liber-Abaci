Original requirements statement:

Please provide a sample project for review:
1. The project should provide a web service.
  a. The web service accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, 
     starting from 0. I.e. given n = 5, appropriate output would represent the sequence "[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]".
  b. Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error.
2. Include whatever instructions are necessary to build and deploy/run the project, 
  where "deploy/run" means the web service is accepting requests and responding to them as appropriate.
3. Include some tests

While this project is admittedly trivial, approach it as representing a more complex problem that you'll have to put into production and maintain for 5 years.
Providing a link to a github/bitbucket repo with the project would probably be the easiest way to submit.
